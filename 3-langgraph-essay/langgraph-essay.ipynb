    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)-powered AI agent to generate, revise, and critique essays using large language models such as Google's [Gemini API in Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) or the [Gemini API in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/overview). The LangGraph code was adapted from the awesome DeepLearning.AI course on [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining a structured state flow with nodes such as \"Planner,\" \"Research Plan,\" \"Generate,\" \"Reflect,\" and \"Research Critique,\" the system iteratively creates an essay on a given topic, incorporates feedback, and provides research-backed insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/3-langgraph-essay.png\" width=\"900px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow enables automated essay generation with revision controls, making it ideal for structured writing tasks or educational use cases. Additionally, the notebook uses external search tools to gather and integrate real-time information into the essay content."

       "## The Devastating Impacts of Hurricane Helene (2024)\n",
       "\n",
       "Hurricane Helene, a powerful Category 4 storm, made landfall near Perry, Florida, in late September 2024.  Its 140 mph winds and torrential rains carved a path of destruction across the Southeast, impacting Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. This essay will examine the multifaceted impacts of Hurricane Helene, focusing on the environmental, economic, and social consequences of this devastating storm.  The storm's widespread effects, spanning nearly 400 miles from Florida's Big Bend to Asheville, North Carolina, underscore the vulnerability of communities to extreme weather events.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Environmental Devastation and Health Risks\n",
       "\n",
       "Hurricane Helene’s environmental impact was severe and far-reaching. Coastal areas experienced significant erosion, reshaping shorelines and threatening coastal ecosystems.  Inland, flooding caused widespread water damage, contaminating water sources and overflowing sewage systems.  The flooding in the North Carolina mountains, in particular, posed significant health risks, as access to clean water and power was cut off for many residents.  The storm also disrupted wildlife, displacing animal populations, damaging nesting sites, and upsetting the delicate balance of natural habitats.  Reports from affected areas highlighted the rising health concerns in the aftermath of the flooding, including waterborne illnesses and the psychological toll on affected communities.\n",

       "## Economic Fallout and Recovery Efforts\n",
       "\n",
       "The economic fallout from Hurricane Helene was substantial.  Early estimates suggest total damages and economic losses could reach as high as $160 billion.  The storm inflicted widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, disrupting transportation and communication networks. Key industries, such as tourism and agriculture, suffered significant losses.  The sheer volume of insurance claims filed underscored the scale of the disaster, and many individuals and businesses faced challenges in obtaining timely financial aid.  While government assistance programs played a crucial role in supporting recovery efforts, the long-term economic recovery prospects for the affected regions remain uncertain.  The storm's impact on industries and infrastructure highlighted the interconnectedness of economic systems and the vulnerability of supply chains to disruptions.\n",

       "\n",
       "Hurricane Helene caused significant social upheaval, displacing thousands of people from their homes and creating a housing crisis in affected areas.  Vulnerable populations were particularly hard hit, facing challenges in accessing essential resources and finding safe shelter.  The storm also exacerbated existing health disparities, as access to healthcare services was limited in some areas.  Despite the widespread devastation, communities demonstrated remarkable resilience, rallying together to support those in need.  Community organizations and volunteers played a vital role in providing shelter, food, and emotional support to displaced residents.  Stories of neighbors helping neighbors emerged as a testament to the strength and compassion of the human spirit in the face of adversity.  The long-term process of rebuilding and recovery will require sustained effort and collaboration among government agencies, community organizations, and individuals.\n"
